# 🛂 How to Apply for an F-1 Student Visa

If you're planning to study in the U.S., you’ll need an **F-1 visa**—the student visa that lets you attend school legally in the States. It sounds intimidating, but don’t worry. It’s very doable if you’re prepared and honest.


## ✅ What You Need Before Applying

| Document | What It’s For |
|----------|----------------|
| **I-20 Form** | Issued by your school after you’re accepted—this is the key document for your visa |
| **Valid Passport** | Must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay |
| **DS-160 Form** | The online visa application form (fill it out carefully!) |
| **Visa Fee Payment** | Pay the non-refundable visa application fee (usually ~$160 USD) |
| **Photo** | Follows U.S. visa photo requirements (you’ll upload this in DS-160 and bring a printed copy)

> 💡 If your passport is about to expire, **renew it first** before starting the visa process.


## 💻 Step-by-Step Application Process

1. **Get Your I-20**
   - Your university will issue this once you’re admitted and you’ve confirmed enrollment.
   - Make sure your name, program, and dates are correct.

2. **Fill Out the DS-160 Form**
   - [Fill it here](https://ceac.state.gov/CEAC)
   - Double-check all your info, typos can delay your visa
   - Be honest while filling the form
   - Save the confirmation page (you’ll need it for the interview)

3. **Pay the SEVIS Fee**
   - This is separate from your visa application fee and is required for F-1 students
   - Save the payment file for later use

4. **Schedule a Visa Interview**
   - Book your appointment through your nearest U.S. embassy/consulate
   - You’ll need your DS-160 confirmation and fee receipts

5. **Attend the Interview**
   - Be calm, be honest
   - Common questions:
     - Why this school?
     - What’s your major?
     - What's your plan after graduation? (Do you plan to return to your home country?)
   - Bring all your documents in a folder, including but not limited to:
     - I-20
     - DS-160 confirmation
     - Passport
     - Visa fee + SEVIS fee receipts
     - Offer/admission letter
     - Financial documents (bank statements, sponsor letters)
     > A family photo is optional, but can show the interviewer you won't hack in the states



## 🧳 After the Interview

- If approved, they’ll **keep your passport** to place the visa sticker
- You’ll get it back in a few days (varies by location)
- Once you have your visa in hand, you’re all set to enter the U.S.!



## 🙋‍♀️ Final Tips

- Be confident. The F-1 visa is generally easier to get than you think.
- You’re literally going to study and pay tuition and spend tons of money(aka boosting the U.S. economy)
- Don’t overthink your answers. Just be real and straightforward.
