# 💸 How to File Taxes as an International Student (F-1 Visa)

 Filing taxes for the first time + in a foreign country + using your second language? Sounds scary, but girl I got ur back, it’s not as stressful as it seems.


## 📆 Deadline: April 15 Every Year

If you’ve worked and earned money in the U.S., you’ll need to file a **tax return** by **April 15** of the following year.  
Even if you didn’t work, some F-1 students still need to file a basic form called **Form 8843**.


## 🧾 Why You Should File

- ✅ It’s legally required.
- 💰 You may get **money back** (tax refund) from the government.
- 🧍‍♀️ Most local students file with their parents, but **we do it on our own**, which actually means *less paperwork*.



## 📑 What to Prepare

Here’s what you’ll typically need:

| Document | What It’s For |
|----------|----------------|
| **SSN** | Your taxpayer ID number |
| **W-2 Form** | Provided by your employer/school, it shows your income & tax withholdings |
| **Passport** | Identity verification |
| **Bank Tax Forms (e.g., 1099-INT)** | If you earned interest from a savings account |
| **Brokerage Tax Forms (e.g., 1099-DIV, 1099-B)** | If you earned dividends or sold stocks/crypto (e.g., Webull, Fidelity, etc.) |
| **Scholarship Tax Info** | Sometimes schools give a small credit (like $1,000)—check your student portal or email |
| **Treaty Info (if applicable)** | Some countries (like China) have tax treaties with the U.S. that give benefits—check your eligibility |

> 💡 Ask your employer/school for your **W-2** by January/February—it’s usually auto-delivered via email or HR systems.


## 🧰 How to File

### ✅ Step 1: Gather All Your Docs

Check the info above for preparation.

### ✅ Step 2: Choose a Tool to Help You File

Some services look free but sneak in fees. Be really careful (unless u r kinda rich and really don't mind :)) Here are a few student-friendly options:

- **[FreeTaxUSA](https://www.freetaxusa.com)** — Personally recommended, easy to use.
- **[Sprintax](https://www.sprintax.com)** — Designed for international students (sometimes your school provides a discount code).
- **[IRS Free File](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)** — Official IRS partner tools (some are free if your income is under a certain limit).

> ⚠️ Avoid shady websites that ask for credit card info before filing—**most international students qualify for free tools.**

### ✅ Step 3: Submit It!

You have two options:
- 🖨️ **Print & mail** your forms to the IRS  
- 📩 **E-file** directly through the platform (Recommended! It’s faster and cheaper)

Once filed, just sit back and wait for your tax refund (if eligible) to hit your bank account. 🎉


## 🧠 Tips & Notes

- 💼 F-1 students usually don’t run personal businesses, (we are not allowed to btw,) so you *probably* don’t need to worry about complicated tax forms.
- 👀 Keep an eye on your email in case your school sends out any **student tax credits**.
- 🛡️ Never share your SSN or tax info on unverified websites.
- 🧾 Save a digital + printed copy of your tax return in your important documents folder. Save it ontime, sometimes the website will expire the file, that you might need in the future.
