# 🧾 How to Apply for a Social Security Number (SSN) as an International Student

## 📌 What Is an SSN?

A **Social Security Number (SSN)** is a 9-digit number issued by the U.S. government that is primarily used for tracking income and taxes. As an international student (F-1 visa), you’ll *only* need an SSN if you have a job offer—either on-campus or with authorized off-campus employment (like CPT/OPT).


## ✅ Who Can Apply?

To be eligible for an SSN, you must:
- Be in the U.S. on an **F-1 visa**
- Have a **job offer** (usually on-campus or CPT/OPT)
- Be **authorized to work** (via your school's OISS or USCIS)


## 📝 What You’ll Need to Apply

Here’s a checklist of documents you’ll typically need when visiting the Social Security office:

### 1. **Job Offer Letter**
- This should be on official letterhead from your employer (usually your school’s department)
- If it’s an on-campus job, the **OISS office** usually prepares a separate verification letter for you
> ⚠️ **Do NOT just show an email screenshot**, I learned from a hard way 🥲

### 2. **I-20 Form**
- Signed and up to date
> ⚠️ **Need to be signed**, we usually print the original unsigned i-20, would get rej too. Again, learned from a hard way lol

### 3. **Valid Passport**  
- Must be unexpired

### 4. **I-94 Record**

## 📞 How to Apply

1. **Call your local Social Security Administration (SSA) office** to make an appointment.  
   The wait time can be *very long*, so be prepared for a marathon phone call 😵‍💫  
   (Tip: Try calling early in the morning.)
   > I attend college (apply for ssn) during covid, and my local SSA's appointment is by calling only. Maybe they open more options like book an appoinment through online now.

2. **Go to the appointment in person**  
   Bring all the required documents listed above.

3. **Submit your documents and answer a few simple questions.**  
   The SSA officer will check everything and prepare the paperwork for you. No need to nervous, they are usually chill.

4. **If approved, they’ll keep your passport temporarily** to process the application.  
   > ⚠️ **Important:** Do *not* move to a new address until you receive your SSN card and your passport in the mail.


## 📨 After You Apply

- Your **SSN card** will arrive in the mail within **2–4 weeks**.
- It’ll be a simple envelope with a paper card inside—**don’t lose it**!


## 🔐 Tips for Using & Protecting Your SSN

- **Do not carry your SSN card around.** Store it somewhere safe with your passport, I-20, etc.
- **Memorize your SSN.** You’ll use it for job applications, tax forms, and bank accounts.
- **Be cautious of scams.** Never share your SSN unless:
  - You’re filling out **official** tax/employment forms
  - You’re opening a legitimate bank account
  - You're onboarding with a verified employer

> 🚩 If a random website or unknown person asks for your SSN during an application, **close the tab**.

## 🧠 Final Advice

- Double-check all your documents **before** your appointment.
- If the SSA officer asks you to come back, try to **schedule your follow-up in person** to avoid calling again.
- Once you get your SSN card, treat it like gold—replacing it is a pain, and you only get limited chances.
