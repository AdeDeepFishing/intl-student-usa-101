# 🏦 How to Open a Bank Account in the U.S. (as an International Student)

Having a U.S. bank account is essential, so you’ll receive money, pay for rent, split bills, and eventually start building credit easily. Don’t worry, the process is simple once you’re here.


## ✅ What to Bring

To open a bank account, walk into a local bank branch with:

- **Passport**
- **I-20 form**
- **Cash or check** (the money you want to deposit)
- (Optional) **School ID** or proof of address if they ask

That’s it! No SSN required at most major banks for international students.


## 🏛️ Checking vs. Savings Accounts

### 🔁 Checking Account
This is your everyday account for things like:
- Paying rent
- Buying groceries
- Sending/receiving money via Zelle or Venmo

> 💡 Personally, I opened a checking account with **Chase** and **BoA**, cuz they are super common and student-friendly. Most people around me use Chase too, so Zelle works seamlessly when splitting bills.

### 💰 Regular Savings Account
Usually offered together with checking. It earns a small amount of interest and is good for:
- Parking extra cash
- Separating money you don’t plan to spend immediately

### 📈 High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)
This one earns **much more** interest than regular savings (though it’s usually online-only). Great for:
- Saving emergency funds
- Practicing long-term money habits

> 💸 I personally use **Marcus by Goldman Sachs**.

## 💳 Credit Cards & Building Credit

In the U.S., **credit scores matter a lot**, for housing, phones, even job applications sometimes.

The easiest way to start building credit:
- Open a **student-friendly credit card**
- Use it for **small** purchases
- **Pay it off in full and on time** every month

Repeat that cycle, and your score will slowly grow.

## 📱 Mobile Banking & Payments

- Use your bank’s mobile app to track your spending and transfer money
- **Apple Pay** is super common, so no need to carry your card
- If you lose your card (it happens), you can still tap to pay while waiting for a replacement


## 🧠 Final Tips

- Avoid accounts with monthly fees! many student accounts are free
- Keep an eye out for new student promos (some banks offer $50–$200 to open an account)
- You can always switch later if you don’t like your first bank
- Don’t ignore your savings, it’s good practice for adulthood (and emergencies)
