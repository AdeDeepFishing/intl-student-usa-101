# 🏠 How to Find Housing as an International Student  
(on-campus, off-campus, and everything in between)

For many international students, housing is one of the first and most stressful challenges to figure out. Here’s a full breakdown of what to expect, how to prepare, and what nobody tells you.

## 🏫 On-Campus Housing (Freshman & Sophomore Years)

Most universities provide dorms for first-year and sometimes second-year students.

**What to expect:**
- Shared rooms: usually 2–3 people per room, with shared restrooms
- **Mandatory meal plan** (included in the price), which makes it feel like you’re eating out every day
- Very limited cooking space (usually just a microwave per floor or shared kitchen for the whole building 💀)

**Pros:**
- You meet a lot of people fastly. Roommates and floormates often become your first friend group
- Easy to walk to class, dining halls, and events
- No need to worry about lease terms or setting up utilities

**Cons:**
- Not cheap, because of the meal plan
- Small space and no privacy
- Your roommates are randomly assigned (maybe it's a pro?)

> Personal tip: Some of my besties & closest friends came from my dorm floor during my first year on campus. Those are your default friends while starting your college life. There are ups and downs, but it’s a core part of the college experience for many students.

## 🏡 University-Owned Apartments (Off-Campus but School-Managed)

Some universities offer off-campus apartments for upperclassmen. These are usually larger and more like shared houses.

**What to expect:**
- 2–3 bedrooms per unit, with 2–3 people per room
- Shared kitchen and bathrooms
- University-run system, but **not always guaranteed** (my school uses a lottery system)

**Pros:**
- More space and privacy than dorms
- No need to pay rent over summer if you’re not staying
- Still under school housing rules, so safer for many students

**Cons:**
- May not get a spot if it’s lottery-based
- Shared rooms and bathrooms again
- Random housemates if you don't have enough same sex friends

## 🏘️ Renting Independently (Off-Campus Housing)

This is the big one! Renting on your own or with friends outside of school housing.

### Rent Tips

- The closer to campus, the higher the rent 💸
- House hunting usually starts **9–12 months in advance**
  - If you want housing starting next August, start looking by **November or December**
- Most leases are for **a full year**, even if your academic year is only 9–10 months

### Moving Reality

- Moving is hard, especially with no car and no help
- In my first summer, I moved 4 times. It was rough. 
- In my last year during collge, I chose a longer-term lease and stayed put. Best decision ever.

### Lease & Guarantor Tips

- Most U.S. apartments require:
  - A credit check
  - Proof of income
  - A **guarantor** (sponsor), usually a parent
- If your parents are not U.S. citizens or don’t have U.S. credit history, some landlords will ask you to use a **guarantee company**
  - This can cost money (like $500+) and is usually **non-refundable**
  - Alternative: Talk to your apartment office directly
    - Offer to pay a **higher security deposit**
    - Or offer to **pay a few months of rent upfront**
    - Many will say yes if you ask—**just be polite and explain your situation**

> Real story: I avoided a $500 guarantee fee by asking my apartment office if I could just pay more deposit instead. They agreed, and I got the money back later when I moved out. The worst they can say is no, which is no difference from the first situation. But imagine they say yes 👀

### Pro tip for international students

- When buying furniture or things for your room, always remember: **you’ll move again someday**
- It’s okay to get things you love, but try to pick items that are lightweight, secondhand, or easy to resell
- I had to say goodbye to so many plushies when I moved out of the states 😭 Be wise, and plan ahead.

## ✅ Summary

| Option | Good for | Watch out for |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Dorms** | First-years, meeting people | Expensive, small space |
| **University Apartments** | Upperclassmen, no summer rent | Not guaranteed |
| **Independent Renting** | More privacy, flexibility | Lease terms, moving pain, guarantor issues |
