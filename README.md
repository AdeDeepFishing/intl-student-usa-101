## ✍️ Why This Exists

I was an international student who made it through the ups and downs of U.S. college life.  
I learned a lot—sometimes the hard way, so I wanna sharing what I wish I had known when I first arrived.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, confused, or just curious, I hope this guide makes your journey a little smoother.
